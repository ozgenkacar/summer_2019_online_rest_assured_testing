//How to deal with nested JSON response?
        //OR
        //How to deserialize nested JSON?
        // we can use List of Map where key is a string, and value is an object or?
        // List<Map<String, ?>> or List<Map<String, Object>>
        //or we can create a POJO by using composition:
        /**
         * public class Person{
         *     private String name;
         *     private String jobTitle;
         *     private Address address;
         *
         *
         *     class Address{
         *         private String street;
         *         private int aptNumber;
         *         private int zipCode;
         *     }
         * }
         *
         * What are the requirements to POJO class?
         *  - private instance variables
         *  - getters/setters
         *  - public no-arguments constructor
         *
         *  Everything else is optional.
         *  We can override toString() method
         *  to see information about object in plain text.
         *  Or, human readable representation of the object.
         *
         *
         *  Also, we can override equals() method to determine if 2 objects are equals
         *  Keep in mind, that variable names should match with JSON variable names.
         *  Otherwise, provide @SerializedName annotation.
         *
         *
         * When one object is using another objects as instance variables,
         * it calls composition. So we are able to use in one object,
         * things from another object without inheritance. So Person in not a Address
         * but Person has a Address. Instead of is-a relationship we have has-a relationship
         * between classes.

         *          (convert it from POJO(java object) into stream of bytes, or for example into JSON
         *          RestAssured use Gson library to convert java object into JSON
         *          We hae added Gson as maven dependency
         * when().
         *  To specify:
         *          HTTP verb/method, request:
         *          get(),put(),post(),delete(),patch()
         *
         *          we can specify request with or without path:
         *          get() or get("/students")
         *
         *          with or without path parameters:
         *          get("/students/student/{student_id}", 55)
         * then(). <- for assertions:
         *          - check status code -->
